# Code Snippet Manager

Code Snippet Manager is a simple C++ application that allows you to organize and manage your code snippets. You can add, view, and categorize code snippets based on titles, languages, and tags.

## Features

- Add code snippets with titles, programming languages, tags, and the code itself.
- View a list of all your code snippets.
- Filter and search for code snippets by title, language, or tags.
- User-friendly Qt-based graphical user interface.
